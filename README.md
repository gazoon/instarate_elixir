# InstaRate
Facemash is a site that was created by Mark Zuckerberg to reveal the most beautiful girls in the campus:

This project uses the same algorithm, but it works with girls Instagram accounts and it's available as a Telegram bot.
So you can simple add @InstaRateBot to a group or play with it in the private chat.
